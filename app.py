I need your help to generate the course title, description, and learning objective, please follow the below template.

The course is about the topic the user input in online math tutoring session.

You should generate below 3 components, the title of the course, the course description, and the learning objectives, according to the requirements:

1.Course Title: Generate a title of this tutor training course using three words, the title should begin with a verb. It should be related to the specific topic of the research paper and the course objective.
Example titles are: Managing inequity, Managing effective praise

2.Description: A short description (50-60 words) about the purpose of this course and why it's important for the tutor. The structure could be similar to: Have you ever met a situation when you are in an online tutoring session, you find your students are [the background of the tutoring topic] and you want to change the situation? In this module, we will be introducing [strategy name] as a way of tutoring students in an online session more effectively.

3. Learning Objectives (15-20 words for each):
Requirement for generation: You should generate 2 learning objectives. The learning objectives should address the "understanding" and the "creating" level of Bloom's taxonomy. Understanding means Constructing meaning from oral, written, and graphic messages through interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, inferring, comparing, and explaining.

Creating means putting elements together to form a coherent or functional whole; reorganizing elements into a new pattern or structure through generating, planning, or producing.

Objective 1: Describe the expected outcome of this course.
Objective 2: Outline what learners will achieve by the end of this module regarding the second objective.

One of the objectives should clearly state the most effective strategy about how to apply this tutoring strategy in online tutoring session that is advocated in the retrieved research paper.

Scenario Structure:
Scenario 1: Describe an initial training scenario involving a common situation related to the course title and learning objectives when a teacher is tutoring online.
Scenario Context: Create a scenario involving a challenge related to the topic of the paper when the teacher is tutoring a student named [Student Name A]. The scenario should focus on the student's response that relates to the course topic. Use approximately 50 words.
Questions:
1. Constructed-response Open-Ended Question (Motivation):
    * Question: Ask participants to propose their response or solution to the scenario, directly addressing the mathematical topic-related issue in the scenario.
    * Purpose: Initial reaction, free expression.
    * Reason: Encourages creative thinking and reflection.
2. Selected-response Question (Assessment of Understanding):
    * Question: Present four possible tutor responses in conversation style about how to teach math effectively, and all responses should reflect the usage of the research recommendations with varied appropriateness, that could be applied in the scenario. Ask tutors to choose the most effective option which is most related to the research recommendation of the papers.
    * Requirements:
        * Make one option correct, aligning with the paper's suggestion.
        * One option should be obviously wrong/unrelated.
        * Two options should be close distractions but not aligned with the paper's recommendation.
        * Ensure all options are similar in length (20-30 words each).
    * Options:

        * B. [Option B]
        * C. [Option C]
        * D. [Option D]
    * Mark the correct one and explain why the others are incorrect.
3. Constructed-response Open-Ended Question (Justification):
    * Question: Ask participants to explain why they chose the specific option in the previous question, detailing the reasoning behind their selection.
    * Purpose: Encourage deep reasoning and reflection to reinforce the tutor's understanding and justification.
    * Reason: Ensures participants can justify their choices and demonstrate a solid grasp of effective teaching strategies related to the scenario.
4. Selected-response Question (Assessment of Understanding):
    * Question: Present four possible tutor responses about how to teach this math topic effectively (statements, not conversations) that align with the responses in the previous questions, revealing the research-recommended strategy for the formative training scenario. Ask participants to select the principle that best supports their chosen response.
    * Requirements:
